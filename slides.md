### Scientific Data Sets (Excel)

(table of iris data)

### Data Set File Types

Excel is a popular spreadsheet program, but it's default file format can be difficult for programs to interpret.

(utf-8/raw xlsx )

### Data Set File Types (CSV)

**C**oma **S**eperated **V**ariable or CSV files have a simple format that programs can read (parse) easily.

(utf-8/raw csv)

### Data Set File Types (TSV)

**T**ab **S**eperated **V**ariable or TSV files are similar to CSVs.

Often used by data scientist, since the format is esaier to read in command line than CSV.

(utf-8/raw tsv)

### Data Set File Types (JSON)

**J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N*otation or JSON is a common format for web applications.

Unlike the previous examples, JSON does not need to represent a table.

(utf-8/raw json compressed)
(utf-8/raw json long)
